# ISLA
aka IDIOT SLA :)


a extremly Simple and rude sla client my personal testing daylight resin

Client python  for use result from lautr3k.github.io/SLAcer.js/ project


Need python 2.7 with PIL and PYserial

use your wintab or linuxtab with python and launch ISLA
Close it in your sla macchine..

open web inteface on with IP of tablet

add parameter and start.


to do list:
- write better code :D
- add upload slacer file
- sync real sync motion with images(less print time)
- start testing

why no use nanodlp? based on rpi/linux and i have a wintab...and no open :)

Moral support for lautr3k.github.io/SLAcer.js/
